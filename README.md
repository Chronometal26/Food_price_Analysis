# Food_price_Analysis

The analysis on Food Price explores key insights into the average prices of various food items, comparing their values in dollars, assessing the potential influence of quality on average price, and projecting their implications on dollar pricing. In this data analysis on Food Price, I used a CSV dataset sourced from Kaggle, provided by [SUMAN GODA/ HUMANITARIAN DATA EXCHANGE], titled 'Vital Food Costs: A Five-Nation Analysis 2018-2022.' I would like to acknowledge their valuable contribution in making this dataset available for analysis.  This is my first project on GitHub! I'm incredibly proud of my work here and excited to learn from it as I strive to make even greater strides in my upcoming projects.
